# gatsby-theme-~byfolio~-banshorian



## What this fork sets out to do

Build and tweak on existing elements. special focus on the menu-transision. i loved the "melting page effekt" i wanted to be able to incorporate a icon/logo into the transision so that one can get a custom-desgin-feel easy generated by a logo or icon element from site. 

I want to give it a brush-up with a style-concept like **"Banshee series"** meets **"the mandalorian series"** and gave birth to showcase:project/person:application-development site. 

workin progress..

Please refer to https://github.com/christiandavid/gatsby-theme-byfolio if you wish to use this for your own site, this repo will be under development and not to be use in a prodcution enviroment at this time.

### TransitionLink

TransitionLink is a flexible and powerful way to write your own page transitions. If you want to use some default transitions with minimal effort, try AniLink.

TRANSITIONLINK
USAGE EXAMPLES
PAGE & TEMPLATE TRANSITION PROPS
PROPS & OPTIONS
USAGE
There are two main ways to use TransitionLink.

Call a trigger function to manipulate the DOM with something like gsap.
Use the TransitionState component alongside TransitionLink or use page / template props to animate your components with something like react-spring, react-pose or CSS transitions.
Check below for documentation of all available props and transition options.

Here is a brief example of what a TransitionLink might look like for a function based gsap transition.
```
<TransitionLink
  to="/page-2"
  exit={{
    trigger: ({ exit, node }) => this.interestingExitAnimation(exit, node),
    length: 1
  }}
  entry={{
    delay: 0.6
  }}
>
  Go to page 2
</TransitionLink>
```

This is an example of what a TransitionLink might look like for a state based transition using react-spring or react-pose. See the TransitionState component docs for more info on what your components might look like.

```
<TransitionLink
  to="/page-2"
  exit={{
    length: 1
  }}
  entry={{
    delay: 0.6
  }}
>
  Go to page 2
</TransitionLink>
```

### PAGE / TEMPLATE PROPS

Your pages and templates will receive three props:
``
transitionStatus
entry
exit
```
const PageOrTemplate = ({ children, transitionStatus, entry, exit}) => {
    console.log(transitionStatus, entry, exit)
    return <div className={transitionStatus}>{children}</div>;
}
```
transitionStatus contains the current page transitions status (either exiting, exited, entering, or entered).

exit and entry contain the entry and exit props and state passed from TransitionLink.
```
<TransitionLink
  to="/page-2"
  exit={{
    length: 1
    state: { pass: 'this to the exiting page' }
  }}
  entry={{
    ...
    state: { you: 'can add anything you want here' }
  }}
>
  Go to page 2
</TransitionLink>
```
In some cases this can cause performance issues because there are extra re-renders happening on your pages or templates. You can disable this with a plugin option.

```
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-transition-link',
      options: {
        injectPageProps: false,
      },
    },
```
### PROPS AND OPTIONS

#### TO, ACTIVECLASS & CLASSNAME PROPS

These are used exactly as they are in gatsby-link.
```
<TransitionLink to="/page-2" activeClass="active" className="transition-link">
  Go to page 2
</TransitionLink>
```
#### EXIT & ENTRY PROPS

Each takes an object of transition options to be applied to the exiting and entering pages respectively.
```
<TransitionLink
  to="/page-2"
  exit={{
    ... // exit transition options
  }}
  entry={{
    ... // entry transition options
  }}
>
  Go to page 2
</TransitionLink>
```
#### TRIGGER OPTION

This takes a function with access to the DOM node of the exiting or entering page, the users mouse event, and both the full exit and entry props.
```
exit={{
  trigger: ({ node, e, exit, entry }) => console.log(node, e, exit, entry)
  // here node refers to the DOM node of the exiting page
}}
entry={{
  trigger: ({ node, e, exit, entry }) => console.log(node, e, exit, entry)
  // here node refers to the DOM node of the entering page
}}
```
#### LENGTH OPTION

This is the duration in seconds of the exit and/or entry animation. If no delay is specified these will start at the same time.
```
exit={{
  length: 2
}}
entry={{
  length: 1
}}
```
#### DELAY OPTION

This is the duration in seconds to delay before beginning the animation. See the timeline for more information on how this effects animation duration.
```
entry={{
  delay: 0.5
}}
ZINDEX OPTION
This is the zIndex of the page wrapper.

exit={{
  zIndex: 2 // exit default is 0
}}
entry={{
  zIndex: 0 // entry default is 1
}}
```
#### STATE OPTION

This is the state to be passed as props to the page or template component of the exiting or entering page. It is also accessible anywhere in your app using the TransitionState component.
```
exit={{
  state: {
    thisIs: 'passed to the exiting page'
  }
}}
entry={{
  state: {
    thisIs: 'passed to the entering page'
  }
}}
```
#### APPEARAFTER OPTION

The appearAfter option will keep a page hidden, but rendered for the amount of time specified. This is useful for if you want to measure an element on the page before displaying it.
```
<TransitionLink
    entry={{
        appearAfter: 2,
        length: 1,
    }}
>
    Go to page 2
</TransitionLink>
```
#### TRIGGER PROP

The trigger prop takes a function that is the equivalent of combining the entry and exit trigger functions. This allows you to do things like measure elements on the entering and exiting pages and morph one element into another.
``` 
<TransitionLink
    entry={{
        appearAfter: 2,
        length: 1,
    }}
    trigger={async pages => {
        // wait until we have access to both pages
        const exit = await pages.exit
        const entry = await pages.entry
        // here we can access both pages


        // You could measure the entry element here
        
        // start exit animation based on measurements if you want 
        // wait for the entering page to become visible
        await entry.visible
        // the entering page is visible here.
        // if you want you can animate it now!
    }}
>
    Maybe morph to page 3
</TransitionLink>
```

## Adding experience and skills

This theme generates pages based on Markdown files in the `path`/experience directory. Your Markdown files should contain some frontmatter defining their company, logo, etc.
All company logos must be relative to `imagesPath`/companies directory.
All Skills logos must be relative to `imagesPath`/skills directory.
All layout images must be relative to company directory, for example: `imagesPath`/companies/vlooping

### Important

For each Skill you must add the logo of the Framework, library or program, with a resolution of **width: 500px, height: 500px**, in the src/images/skills/ directory I leave several logos, **only Skills logos that I own are present, if the logo you need does not appear you must create it**.

Layout number is for image animation you can select from 1 to 5, **please do not forget to add the images "images/companies/vlooping.png, images/skills/html5.png, images/skills/react.png, images/companies/vlooping/vlooping.png" to run the following example**

```yaml

- Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text
- It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
- There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available
- The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested

### Skills

The Skills are automatically selected from experience, in case some skill you acquired does not correspond to a company you can add it in `path`/experience/\_additionalSkills.md

```yaml

## Component shadowing

You can customize elements like the css style or about-me content by taking advantage of [component shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-04-29-component-shadowing/).

I recommend using [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to select a color palette and adapt it to your new portfolio.

You can change the color of the text and the background of each page, for example:

```js
// src/@christiandavid/gatsby-theme-byfolio/layout/layoutColors.css.js
import { css } from "@emotion/core"
import lineSvg from "../../../static/assets/line.svg"

const styles = css`
  .e404.layout-wrapper .layout-inner {
    background: #fff;
  }
  .e404 .data-section {
    color: #000;
  }
  .aboutme.layout-wrapper .layout-inner {
    background: #fff;
  }
  .aboutme .data-section {
    color: #000;
  }
  .aboutme .hamburgercolr::before,
  .aboutme .hamburgercolr::after,
  .e404 .hamburgercolr::before,
  .e404 .hamburgercolr::after {
    background-color: #000;
  }
  .home.layout-wrapper .layout-inner {
    background: #0e0f11;
    background: #0e0f11 url(${lineSvg}) center center fixed;
    background-size: contain;
  }
  .home.layout-wrapper h1,
  .home.layout-wrapper h2 {
    color: #fff;
  }
  .skill.layout-wrapper .layout-inner {
    color: #fff;
    background: #9d316e;
    background: url(${lineSvg}) center center fixed, linear-gradient(
        45deg,
        #9d316e,
        #de2d3e
      );
    background-size: cover;
  }
  .experience.layout-wrapper .layout-inner {
    background: #3a3d98;
    background: url(${lineSvg}) center center fixed, linear-gradient(
        45deg,
        #6f22b9,
        #3a3d98
      );
    background-size: cover;
  }
  .home .hamburgercolr::before,

    "content": "I'm a <strong>Software Developer</strong>"
  },
  {
    "subtitle": "Experience!",
    "content": "I started developing software from <strong>2004</strong> working in several companies"
  }
]
```
